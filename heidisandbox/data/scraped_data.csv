Please send me an email if you're interested in coming to view. Thank you.  The apartment is on the ground floor and has its own entrance. Top quality materials were used throughout. The rooms all have light honey-coloured paint and wood floors, except for the hall, kitchen, and bathroom, which have tiled floors. The heating is via energy-efficient electric radiators and the apartment is fully insulated to minimise heating use. The layout maximises space and all the doors are glass to maximise light. The accommodation consists of:  - A large front room containing a three-seater Parker Knoll sofa, coffee table, a radiator, and a storage cabinet. - A double bedroom containing two bedside lockers, a brass-and-enamel bedframe, a mattress with mattress cover, a radiator, adjustable wood slatted blinds, and a double mirrored Sliderobe wardrobe with fitted interior. - A small hallway with tiled floor and storage space. - A bathroom with tiled floor, a hand-basin and mirror, a lavatory, heater, extractor fan, and an electric shower in a roomy enclosure. The door and window of the bathroom have privacy glass. - A corridor leads to a bright fitted kitchen with tiled floor, Shaker-style cabinets, a four-burner hob with grill and full oven, a combination washing and tumble drying machine, a fridge-freezer, oodles of storage cupboards, a radiator, and an extending table and four chairs.  The apartment comes equipped with a kettle, toaster, pots and pans, crockery, cutlery, an ironing board and iron, a microwave, a hoover, and so on.  Externally there is a roofed open-sided porch framing the front door, with outdoor seating. The gardens around the apartment were laid out by a Gold-medal winning gardener and are now mature; the front garden has flower-beds and flowering trees, and the large back garden has a small screened-off area containing a clothes-line, compost containers and storage, but the majority of the space is laid to lawn and surrounded by shrubbery and trees. There's a pond and bird-tables in one corner, and a patio with a swing-chair in another. The high walls mean the back garden is not overlooked.  The apartment is situated in a leafy, tranquil, and much sought-after estate, which more importantly is a safe and very friendly neighbourhood. There is no through traffic to speak of. There is a private park in the centre of the estate, and a small supermarket and a chemist are just a short stroll away.  The apartment has an excellent location, about five minutes walk from the gates to Malahide Castle and Gardens, which apart from the castle, the gardens, the parkland, the woodland, and the sports facilities, now contains an Avoca shop and cafe for resting up in after using the sports facilities. Malahide village itself is 15 minutes walk away and has lots of amenities: a library, a marina, schools, sports grounds, clubs, associations, gyms, hotels, shops, cafes, restaurants, pubs... too many to list. And of course the estuary and Malahide and Portmarnock beaches are close at hand as well.  The apartment comes with one driveway parking space, plus ample on-street parking. Public transport links are plentiful. The apartment is five minutes walk from the bus stops on the 42 Dublin - Malahide bus route, and the 102 Malahide - Swords - Airport bus route, and less than a mile from Malahide village, which has a railway station served by Dart trains and intercity trains. Depending on traffic, the apartment is 10 minutes drive from Swords, and the Pavilions shopping centre with its multi-screen cinema, 12 minutes from Dubin Airport, and 20 minutes from Dublin city centre. Easy access to the M1 and the M50, too.  The deposit is equal to one month's rent. References are required. Garden maintenance is included in the rent, but please note other bills are not included.
