The rooms all have light honey-coloured paint and wood floors, except for the hall, kitchen, and bathroom, which have tiled floors.

The accommodation consists of:  - A large front room containing a three-seater Parker Knoll sofa, coffee table, a radiator, and a storage cabinet. - A double bedroom containing two bedside lockers, a brass-and-enamel bedframe, a mattress with mattress cover, a radiator, adjustable wood slatted blinds, and a double mirrored Sliderobe wardrobe with fitted interior. - A small hallway with tiled floor and storage space. - A bathroom with tiled floor, a hand-basin and mirror, a lavatory, heater, extractor fan, and an electric shower in a roomy enclosure.

The gardens around the apartment were laid out by a Gold-medal winning gardener and are now mature; the front garden has flower-beds and flowering trees, and the large back garden has a small screened-off area containing a clothes-line, compost containers and storage, but the majority of the space is laid to lawn and surrounded by shrubbery and trees. There's a pond and bird-tables in one corner, and a patio with a swing-chair in another. The high walls mean the back garden is not overlooked.  The apartment is situated in a leafy, tranquil, and much sought-after estate, which more importantly is a safe and very friendly neighbourhood. There is no through traffic to speak of. There is a private park in the centre of the estate, and a small supermarket and a chemist are just a short stroll away.

Public transport links are plentiful. The apartment is five minutes walk from the bus stops on the 42 Dublin - Malahide bus route, and the 102 Malahide - Swords - Airport bus route, and less than a mile from Malahide village, which has a railway station served by Dart trains and intercity trains.

A centralised heating system and cold water storage solution have been installed and this results in more apartment space for the occupier which is not taken up by plant. Each unit has a district heating sub- station and this meters the energy used by the occupant to heat the apartment and generate hot water. While the boiler plant is  not in the apartment each occupier can adjust the operating conditions they require. In tandem with this modern heating solution the apartments have been built with high levels of insulation and air tightness, both of which ensure that heating bills will be lowered. To maintain comfort in the apartments each unit is fitted with a heat recovery ventilation system. The air in the apartment is constantly cycled with stale damp air being removed and fresh outside air in added, in a controlled manner. The heating from the outgoing air stream is transferred across to the incoming fresh air and this greatly limits the heat losses to the space.
